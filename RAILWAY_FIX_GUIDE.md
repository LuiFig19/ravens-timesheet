# üö® URGENT: Fix Railway Blank Page Issue

## The Problem
Your Railway deployment shows a blank page because the environment variables (especially Clerk credentials) are missing.

## üîß **SOLUTION - Follow These Steps:**

### **Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to [https://railway.app/](https://railway.app/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your "ravens-timesheet" project
4. Click on it to open the project

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables**
1. In your Railway project dashboard, click on your service
2. Go to the **"Variables"** tab
3. Add these environment variables **ONE BY ONE**:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-app-url.up.railway.app
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_bW92aW5nLWphdmVsaW4tNzguY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_CGaGZ1qfG9qIJ8OlqYBDFJbSJ257YhSFNnxyhbNCbj
```

### **Step 3: Database Configuration (if using PostgreSQL)**
If you have a PostgreSQL database in Railway, also add:
```env
DB_HOST=your-railway-postgres-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=railway
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-railway-postgres-password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/railway
```

### **Step 4: Update VITE_API_URL**
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace `your-railway-app-url` with your actual Railway app URL:
1. In Railway dashboard, find your app's URL (looks like: `https://something.up.railway.app`)
2. Update `VITE_API_URL` to point to your actual URL

### **Step 5: Redeploy**
1. After adding all environment variables
2. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"** in Railway
3. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### **Step 6: Configure Clerk Domain**
1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.dev/](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/)
2. Select your Ravens TimeSheet application
3. Go to **"Domains"** in the sidebar
4. Add your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)
5. Save the changes

## ‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Railway site loads properly (no blank page)
- ‚úÖ Authentication works
- ‚úÖ All features accessible

## üîç **Troubleshooting:**

### If still blank page:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure Clerk domain is added
4. Try a fresh deployment

### If authentication doesn't work:
1. Double-check Clerk credentials
2. Verify domain is added in Clerk dashboard
3. Check browser console for errors

## üìû **Need Help?**
If you're still having issues:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Railway URL is added to Clerk domains

**The blank page issue will be resolved once environment variables are properly configured in Railway!** üéØ
